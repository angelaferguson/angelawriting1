# Tips for a successful tech review request

You've been working really hard on documenting that new feature, and your docs are almost ready for publishing. You've been fortunate (this time!) to have a realistic timeline, and you've been able to get your draft done more than a week before publishing date!

There's one thing you still need to do.

*Tech Review Request*

Technical review is your chance to get your content in front of the eyeballs of your subject matter experts, or SMEs. They might be developers, product managers, marketing folks, or any number of other people from yours or other departments in your company. The idea is for them to read through your draft content and make sure that it's accurate and complete.

In an ideal situation, your SMEs are enthusiastic about documentation. These doc advocates will zip through your content, and provide comprehensive comments about what works and what can be improved. I've worked with many SMEs like this, and I'm always so grateful to have them in my corner. After all, it works to all of our advantage if the content we're putting in front of our users is *actually correct*, right?

Unfortunately, it's not always that easy. As technical writers, I think we have all experienced this frustrating situation. You've worked hard to document that new feature. You've finished way ahead of deadline, with plenty of time for your SMEs to review your work for accuracy. And that's lucky because there were a couple of small things you weren't 100% sure about in the docs. 

You send your content with an accompanying message *begging* for feedback - something, anything - before publishing day. You might even ask one or two questions right in the email, to make sure everyone knows that there are some open queries.

You wait.

*Crickets*

You run into Casey the product manager in the office kitchen. "Hey, Case, how's that review going?" "Ohhhh sorry! I've been super busy. Will look at it tomorrow."

With two days until publishing, still...*crickets*. You send off another message, this one more urgent than the last. "I'll need your input by tomorrow or else." 

Unfortunately, when you find  yourself in this situation, it's often too late by this stage to get a good review at all. Now your SMEs don't have enough time to really read your content thoroughly, and meanwhile your time is ticking. If there are any major problems with what you've written, you're probably going to have to do your best to cram in the changes. At best, you'll get it all done in time. at worst, you'll have to try your best, and iterate on it for the next doc release.

Sound familiar? I'm sure we've all been there. I wanted to write a few of my own tried-and-true tips for making sure you get feedback, meaningful feedback, with enough time to actually implement it.

Now, I'm not totally naive. I know that it can seem like somewhat of a luxury to have enough time to get your work done early enough for this process to work. But that's a whole separate issue, and I think that if you regularly find that you don't have enough time for a good tech review, then you need to take a look at some of your work processes and see how you could make some time. But I'm going to pretend for the sake of these tips that we're working optimally here, with a bit of time between first draft and publish date.

## Tips for a productive tech review process

These are a few guidelines I try to follow with my tech review requests. My SMEs generally tend to be pretty responsive. After all, people usually have the best intentions of helping, but if you don't present your requests in the right way, they can go pretty low down on the priority list.

### Give a deadline that's *enough* time, but not *too much* time

We're all busy. Our SMEs are busy. As technical writers, we live and breathe documentation, and it's usually the top priority for our jobs. But that product manager might have to present the product roadmap for the coming quarter this week. The developer might be fixing a major bug that has appeared in the very feature you're writing about.
